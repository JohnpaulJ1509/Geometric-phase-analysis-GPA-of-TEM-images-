# Geometric-phase-analysis-GPA-of-TEM-images
Welcome to the Geometric Phase Analysis (GPA) of TEM Images repository! This repository contains codes, theoretical background, examples, and resources related to the geometric phase analysis of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.
Geometric Phase Analysis (GPA) is a powerful technique used in the analysis of strain and displacement fields in TEM images. By extracting phase information from high-resolution TEM images, GPA allows for precise measurement of lattice distortions and strains at the nanoscale.
Geometric Phase Analysis (GPA) roughly involves the following steps:

1. **Fourier Transform**: Convert the real-space TEM image to reciprocal space using a Fourier transform.
2. **Selection of Reflections**: Identify and select specific reflections in the Fourier space that correspond to the periodicities of interest.
3. **Phase Extraction**: Extract the phase information from the selected reflections.
4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: Convert the phase information back to real space to obtain the displacement and strain maps.
